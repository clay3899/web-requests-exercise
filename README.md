# web-requests-exercise

## Repo Setup

Use the GitHub.com online interface to clone  a remote project repository from  https://github.com/clay3899/web-requests-exercise.. When prompted by the GitHub.com online interface, let's get in the habit of adding a "README.md" file and a Python-flavored ".gitignore" file (and also optionally a "LICENSE") during the repo creation process. After this process is complete, you should be able to view the repo on GitHub.com at an address like https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/web-requests-exercise.

After creating the remote repo, use GitHub Desktop software or the command-line to download or "clone" it onto your computer. Choose a familiar download location like the Desktop.

After cloning the repo, navigate there from the command-line:
```sh
cd ~/Desktop/web-requests-exercise
```
Use your text editor or the command-line to create a file in that repo called "get_data.py", and then place the following contents inside:
```sh
# get_data.py

print("REQUESTING SOME DATA FROM THE INTERNET...")

```
Make sure to save Python files like this whenever you're done editing them. After setting up a virtual environment, we will be ready to run this file.





## Environment Setup

Create and activate a new Anaconda virtual environment:
```sh
conda create -n requests-env python=3.7 # (first time only)
conda activate requests-env

```
From within the virtual environment, install the requests package:

```sh
pip install requests

```
From within the virtual environment, demonstrate your ability to run the Python script from the command-line:

```sh
python get_data.py

```
